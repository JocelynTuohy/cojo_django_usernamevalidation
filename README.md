Assignment: Username Validation
Create a new project that will validate a username.

Validate the user as follows:

• length of username should greater than 8 characters

• length of username should be fewer than 26 characters

• If the username is not valid display a notification "Username is not valid" on the root page.

• Once a valid username is entered, save the username to the database.

• On the success page display all the usernames entered, along with the date and the time (e.g. June 24th, 2013, 6:00 PM) that each username was created.
